# Pipeline withCustomCommitStates step #
This step allows a pipeline job to set custom GitHub commit states. The states are being updated in following manner:

1. build **pending** - set before starting the build
2. based on the result, there are two possibilities
    1. build has been **successful** - set after the build finishes without errors
    2. build has **failed** - set after the build finishes with errors or if the build does not finish at all (for example errors in Jenkinsfile, connectivity issues, etc.)

## Example ##
```groovy
  withCustomCommitStates(scm, <CREDENTIALS_ID>, <CONTEXT>) {
    node {
      ...
    }
  }
```
All arguments are **mandatory**.
